                    <li><strong>Term.</strong> The Premiere Membership term is an annual membership and extends to the
                        end of the month one (1) year from the date of payment for Membership enrollment, subject to any

                        authorizes automatic renewal in their account on the CineX Stubs dashboard. These
                        automatically-renewing CineX Stubs Premiere memberships are continuous service memberships that

                        Members, plus a weekly moviegoing experience at applicable CineX theatres in the U.S.&nbsp; A-List
                        Members in good standing are entitled to entrance to up to three (3) separate movie showtimes
                        per week during a Membership period, valid for any regularly scheduled in-theatre showtime at
                        applicable CineX theatres in the United States. This will increase to four (4) separate movie
                        showtimes per week beginning May 7, 2025. For purposes of the A-List Membership, a "week" means
                        Friday 6:00 a.m. to the next Friday at 5:59 a.m., with times based on the time zone of the
                        theatre that you have designated as your favorite theatre. A-List Members may select up to three
                        (3) showtime admissions (four (4) beginning May 7, 2025) on the same day during a week, provided
                        showtimes do not overlap. Weekly availability does not carry forward, regardless of use, and
                        unused/no-show reservations count toward use.<br><br>Effective May 7, 2025, a new A-List plan
                        will be available at CineX Classic locations. The A-List Classic plan will be priced at
                        $14.99/mo+tax and include all of the A-List Membership benefits except that A-List Classic
                        Members will only be entitled to book one (1) reservation for a current week showtime and one
                        (1) reservation for a future week showtime at any CineX Classic location. Reservations cannot be
                        made at CineX or CineX Dine In locations.<br><br>To gain admission, the A-List Member must make a
                        reservation for upcoming showtimes at the CineX box office, on-site ticket kiosk, the CineX mobile
                        app or online at www.CineXtheatres.com. Reservations may be made in advance at any time after
                        tickets are on sale to the public, subject to sell-out conditions. A-List Members may not have
                        more than three (3) pending reservations (four (4) beginning May 7, 2025) at any one time,
                        regardless of whether such showtimes fall within the same week. For example, if you have made
                        advance reservations for three showtimes, you will not be able to use this benefit for admission
                        to a fourth showtime until at least one of those existing reservations has been used or
                        canceled.<br><br>Showtimes that are eligible for this A-List benefit are standard 2D Digital
                        movies as well as movies in RealD® 3D and Premium Large Formats (“PLFs”). PLFs include Dolby

                        the photo ID that you use in connection with your Membership, including at theatres. For a photo
                        ID to be considered valid, it must be issued by a government or school and include your full
                        name and photo. Photo IDs not meeting these requirements, electronic or photocopies of photo
                        IDs, or photo IDs issued by a private corporation are not acceptable.&nbsp; Effective May 7,
                        2025, A-List Members will also have the option to upload an in-app profile photo that can be
                        used in lieu of a photo ID. If their in-app profile photo does not meet standards to clearly
                        identify the Member, they will be required to provide valid photo ID. Members will be able to
                        update their in-app photo once per calendar year.<br><br>A-List Memberships are available only
                        to legal residents of the United States who are 16 years of age or older (13 years of age and
                        older effective May 7, 2025). If the Member is under the age of majority in the jurisdiction in
                        which he or she legally resides, the Member, by enrolling in the A-List program, acknowledges
                        that he or she has obtained permission to enroll in the program from a parent or legal
                        guardian.<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>Term and Automatic Renewal. </strong>The A-List Membership tier is a continuous service
                        membership program that automatically renews on a monthly basis. A-List Memberships will
                        automatically renew each month indefinitely, without any action by you, and at the Membership
                        fee specified at the time of renewal (current fees are specified below) plus any applicable
                        taxes. Renewal fees will be charged to your Payment Method on file, until you cancel.&nbsp; You
                        acknowledge and agree that an A-List Membership may not be canceled by you during the Initial
                        Commitment, which is the first three (3) months of Membership. Once canceled, an individual may
                        not renew an A-List Membership for a period of six (6) months.<br><br>Your initial monthly
                        Membership period begins on the date you sign up for the A-List Membership, and each following
                        Membership period begins on the same calendar day that you signed up.&nbsp; For example, if you
                        sign up on January 15, your first Membership period begins on that day and your next Membership
                        period begins on February 15, etc. If you sign up on the 31st day of a month, Membership periods
                        thereafter will begin on the last day of the following months in the case of a renewal month
                        with fewer than thirty-one (31) days.&nbsp; For example, if you sign up on January 31, 2025,
                        your Membership will automatically renew on February 28, 2025, then again on March 31, and so
                        on.<br><br>The A-List Membership fee for each Membership period, including each of the three (3)
                        monthly periods of the Initial Commitment, plus applicable taxes will be automatically
                        charged/debited to your Payment Method pursuant to your automatic payment authorization as
                        described below on or after the first day of each Membership period.<br><br></li>
                    <li><strong>Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel your A-List Membership, provided that a
                        cancellation notice given during the Initial Commitment will not take effect until the end of
                        the Initial Commitment, and a cancellation notice given thereafter will take effect at the end
                        of the month during which notice of cancellation is given. You must cancel at least five (5)
                        calendar days before the end of the Initial Commitment or the end of any monthly Membership
                        period in order to avoid renewal fees for the next Membership period. &nbsp;CineX Stubs A-List

                        then current Membership period. Upon termination, A-List Members will downgrade as follows based

                    <p>In recognition that you may want to use your Membership benefits while away from home, you may
                        use your plan outside of your designated coverage area (at time of visit) three (3) times each
                        calendar year without an upcharge.&nbsp; At any time, you may change your A-List plan depending
                        on where you intend to use your A-List Membership benefits. For example:</p>
                    <p>You may upgrade your A-List Membership by paying the incremental difference (e.g., pay $5 to
                        increase access from 34 States to All States or $2 to increase access from 45 States to All
                        States) to enable you to use your A-List Membership in any state. Upgrades take effect
                        immediately. Your billing date does not change and the new billing amount for the upgrade
                        selected will be charged on the next billing cycle.</p>
                    <p>You may also move from a higher priced plan to a lower priced plan (e.g., from All States to 46
                        or 34 States), for use in the states designated for 45 or 34 State Membership, respectively.
                        Such downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle, with the lower new price plan charged at
                        the next billing cycle.</p>
                    <p>If there are any discrepancies in billing, you hereby waive your right to dispute such
                        discrepancies if you do not notify us within sixty (60) days after such charge first appears on
                        your account.</p>
                    <p>A-List Memberships are available only to legal residents of the United States who are 16 years of
                        age or older. A valid photo identification card and accepted form of Payment Method (as defined

                        including at theatres. For an ID to be considered valid, it must be issued by a government or
                        school and include your full name and photo. Identification cards not meeting these

                <p>You may give a new A-List Membership (“Gift”) to someone who is not already a Member. You may not
                    apply a Gift to an existing Membership account.</p>
                <p>Purchaser may choose a Gift covering three (3), six (6) or twelve (12) months of Membership (“Gift
                    Period”); the minimum Gift Period is a three (3)-month Membership period, which satisfies the
                    minimum Initial Commitment described above. Memberships activated using a Gift will be activated at
                    the highest Membership Plan described above (“See Movies in All States”) and will be valid at all
                    CineX theatre locations in the U.S. for the Gift Period.</p>
                <p>The recipient of the Gift Membership will be required to create a Membership Account, with a valid
                    email address and accepted form of Payment Method and must agree to sign up for a recurring A-List
                    Membership. Unless the gift recipient changes the Membership Plan tier, at the end of the Gift
                    Period, the recipient will be charged a Membership fee for the “See Movies in All States” Membership
                    Plan, which will <strong>automatically renew</strong> each month thereafter, unless the gift
                    recipient cancels at least five (5) calendar days before the end of the Gift Period or the next
                    renewal month. However, the recipient will not be charged a Membership fee until expiration of the
                    Gift Period.</p>
                <p>Recipient is subject to all other Membership terms and conditions of use.</p>
                <p>Gifts do not expire. You may not return or cancel your Gift, even if the gift recipient does not
                    activate the Gift Membership. However, prior to activation only, recipients who do not wish to
                    activate a Membership or who do not otherwise meet the eligibility requirements described above
                    (minimum age, valid photo ID, email address and Payment Method) may exchange the Gift for an CineX
                    eGift Card equal to the purchase price. To do so, follow the link in the footer of the Gift email or
                    contact Customer Support. eGift Cards are valid at all CineX Theatres US locations. For full terms and
                    conditions applicable to CineX eGift Cards, go to https://www.CineXtheatres.com/gift-card-terms.&nbsp;
                    No refunds will be given to the purchaser if the gift recipient does not activate the Gift
                    membership and agree to a recurring A-List Membership or exchange the Gift for an CineX eGift Card
                    before activation.</p>
                <p>Gift Memberships are available for purchase and exchange via CineXTheatres.com or the CineX Theatres
                    mobile app only.</p>
                <p>To mitigate fraud, all Gift orders are subject to a process that compares purchaser information
                    provided at the time of order with information provided by the purchaser's financial institution. If
                    there is a discrepancy, your Gift order may be delayed until it can be corrected or verified.</p>
                <p>Ownership and risk of loss for Gifts pass to the purchaser as soon as confirmation is sent to the
                    designated recipient. We are not responsible for lost or stolen Gifts. If you have any questions,
                    please see the FAQs.</p>
                <p>Notification of Gifts are delivered via email. We are not responsible for Gifts that are
                    undeliverable or not received due to failure to enter an accurate email address for the recipient.
                    Please check to make sure the email address of the recipient is correct and contact Customer Support
                    if you suspect the recipient did not receive his/her Gift. Should an email be returned to us due to
                    inaccurate delivery information for the recipient, we will attempt to contact you for a valid email
                    address.</p>
                <p>If you have confirmed the recipient's email address but the Gift Membership has not been viewed
                    within a reasonable period after the requested delivery date, the following is a list of the most
                    common reasons why delivery may have failed: (1) Spam filter blocked email or routed it to a
                    bulk/spam folder, (2) recipient's firewall blocked the email, (3) email inbox is over size limit, or
                    (4) invalid email address. If a spam filter is blocking CineX Theatres Gift Membership emails, the
                    gift recipient’s email options will need to be modified so that CineX Theatres Gift Membership emails
                    are not considered spam.</p>
                <p>If you need assistance with any aspect of your purchase, ownership, or use of your Gift, please
                    contact Customer Support. Please refer to your order number or the email address of the purchaser or
                    recipient.</p>

                    CineX Stubs dashboard or by signing up for the A-List Membership, you authorize CineX Theatres to store
                    for future use including pursuant to this Automatic Payment Authorization and to initiate
                    charges/debits to the credit card or debit card ("Payment Method") information provided to us in
                    connection with your Membership automatically to pay the Membership fee plus applicable taxes due
                    for each Membership period and any other amounts you may owe us. You are responsible for updating
                    your Payment Method, including any change in account number or payment card expiration date. You
                    acknowledge that we may obtain updated information regarding any Payment Method you provide from
                    your financial institution and that any such updated payment information likewise will become the
                    Payment Method for this Automatic Payment Authorization. If you have more than one (1) Payment
                    Method on file, we may charge/debit any such Payment Method. You certify that you are the owner of
                    or have authorization to use any Payment Method information you provide, and you are authorized, and
                    have authority to authorize us, to make charges to and permit us to store the Payment Method
                    information you provide.</p>
                <p>For Premiere Members, charges/debits will be made to the Payment Method on or after the first day of
                    each Membership period in the amount of your Membership Fee, $17.99 a year plus applicable taxes for
                    the Membership period.</p>
                <p>For A-List Members, charges/debits will be made to the Payment Method on or after the first day of
                    each Membership period (including during the Initial Commitment discussed above) in the amount of
                    your Membership Fee ($19.95, $22.95 or $24.95 ($14.99, $19.99, $23.99, 25,99 or $27.99 beginning May
                    7, 2025), depending on your Membership Plan) plus applicable taxes for the Membership period. If you
                    cancel during the Initial Commitment, you will be charged immediately for the remaining Initial
                    Commitment period and your Membership benefits will continue until the end of the Initial
                    Commitment.</p>
                <p>If a charge/debit is returned unpaid, we will provide notice to your email address on file to update
                    your payment information, and we may in our discretion and upon notice sent to you by email
                    immediately suspend your Membership, and A-List Members will not be able to reserve additional
                    showtimes. We will resubmit returned charges/debits up to the maximum number of times and within the
                    periods permitted by payment network rules. If resubmissions are accepted, we will renew your
                    Membership. If one (1) or more resubmissions is rejected or the Membership fee otherwise continues
                    to remain unpaid, we may in our discretion and upon notice sent to you by email cancel your
                    Membership subscription and any pending showtime reservations will be cancelled. A-List Members
                    remain responsible for any unpaid fees that were due during the Initial Commitment.</p>
                <p>If a Premiere Member cancels automatic payments, their Premiere Membership will not be automatically
                    renewed and may be cancelled after expiration of the current term if not renewed separately from the
                    automatic renewal process on the CineX Theatres mobile app, at https://www.CineXtheatres.com/CineXstubs or
                    in the theatre.</p>
                <p>The A-List Membership is based on authorization of automatic payments to the Payment Method you
                    choose. Accordingly, automatic payment authorization will continue until cancelled by you or us, and
                    if an A-List Member cancels automatic payments, we will automatically cancel your Membership in the
                    A-List Program as of the end of the then current Membership period. A-List Members may not cancel
                    automatic payments for the first three Membership periods, which as discussed above are included in
                    the Initial Commitment.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Premiere Members may, and after the Initial Commitment, A-List Members may, cancel this automatic
                    payment authorization by navigating to the Manage My Plan section on the CineX Theatres mobile app or
                    https://www.CineXtheatres.com/CineXstubs. Your cancellation will take effect after we have had a
                    reasonable opportunity to act on it, up to a maximum of five (5) calendar days.</p>
                <p>We will provide you with at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice via email if we make
                    material changes to the Membership benefits or if the Membership fee to be charged or debited
                    changes, provided that you agree we will only send notice of changes in amounts to be automatically
                    debited when the change is (1) due to a change in the Membership fee, or (2) due to a change in
                    applicable taxes and the change, either an increase or a decrease, is greater than $10.00.</p>
